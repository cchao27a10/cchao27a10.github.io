<h2>About Ramen</h2>
<p>Ramen is a beloved and iconic noodle soup that originated in Japan, though it draws inspiration from Chinese culinary traditions. At its heart, ramen features springy, Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a steaming, umami-rich broth that can be based on pork, chicken, beef, or seafood. The broth is often meticulously simmered for hours to extract deep, complex flavors and may be further enhanced with savory elements like soy sauce, miso, or salt.</p>
<p>Each bowl of ramen is a carefully crafted experience, typically adorned with an array of mouthwatering toppings. Common garnishes include tender slices of chashu (braised pork belly), ajitsuke tamago (soft-boiled eggs marinated in soy sauce), nori (crisp sheets of dried seaweed), menma (fermented bamboo shoots), sweet corn, scallions, and even narutomaki (the iconic pink-and-white fish cake). These components not only add bursts of texture and color but also elevate the dish into a harmonious balance of richness, saltiness, and umami.</p>
<p>Ramen’s popularity has transcended its Japanese roots, evolving into a global culinary sensation. Across the world, chefs have embraced the dish, experimenting with fusion elements, regional ingredients, and unique presentation styles—from creamy tonkotsu ramen in Fukuoka to spicy miso ramen in Hokkaido, and inventive vegan or seafood variations in cities like Los Angeles, London, and Sydney. Each bowl tells a different story, reflective of both tradition and innovation.</p>
<p>To complete the meal, ramen is often paired with flavorful accompaniments such as gyoza—pan-fried Japanese dumplings with juicy pork and vegetable fillings—or a side of aromatic fried rice. These additions round out the dining experience, making it hearty and deeply satisfying.</p>

<h3>Types of Ramen</h3>
<p>Ramen comes in various styles, each with its unique flavor profile and ingredients. Here are some popular types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tonkotsu Ramen:</strong> Hakata ramen originates from Hakata district of Fukuoka city in Kyushu. It has a rich, milky, pork-bone tonkotsu broth and rather thin, non-curly and resilient noodles. Often, distinctive toppings such as crushed garlic, beni shōga (pickled ginger), sesame seeds, and spicy pickled mustard greens (karashi takana) are left on tables for customers to serve themselves</li>

<li><strong>Shoyu Ramen:</strong>Tokyo-style ramen consists of slightly thin, curly noodles served in a soy-flavored chicken broth. The Tokyo-style broth typically has a touch of dashi, as old ramen establishments in Tokyo often originate from soba eateries. Standard toppings are chopped scallion, menma, sliced pork, kamaboko, egg, nori, and spinach.</li>

<h4>History of Ramen</h4>
<h5>Origins</h5>
<p>Ramen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodle soups. It is first recorded to have appeared in Yokohama Chinatown in the early 20th century. However, the dishes ancestral to ramen already existed in Japan within the Chinese community since the 1880s. Although ramen takes its name from lamian, it did not originate from the hand-pulled lamian noodles of northern China, since the noodles used in ramen are cut, not pulled. Rather, ramen is largely derived from southern Chinese noodle dishes, particularly those from Cantonese cuisine. This is reflective of Yokohama Chinatown's demographics, as the majority of Chinese settlers there were Cantonese, followed by Shanghainese.</p>
<p>The official diary of Shōkoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, Inryōken Nichiroku (蔭涼軒日録), mentions eating jīngdàimiàn (経帯麪), noodles with kansui, in 1488. Jīngdàimiàn is the noodle of the Yuan dynasty. This is the earliest record of kansui noodles being eaten in Japan.</p>
<p>One theory says that ramen was introduced to Japan during the 1660s by the neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Shunsui, who served as an advisor to Tokugawa Mitsukuni after he became a refugee in Japan to escape Manchu rule. Mitsukuni became the first Japanese person to eat ramen. However, the noodles Mitsukuni ate were a mixture of starch made from lotus root and wheat flour, which is different from chūkamen with kansui.</p>
<p>According to historians, the more plausible theory is that ramen was introduced to Japan in the late 19th century by Chinese immigrants living in Yokohama Chinatown. By 1884, Chinese noodle soups had grown popular in Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki, and Hakodate, however, this popularity was mostly concentrated among Chinese immigrants. The Chinese served a variety of noodle soup dishes and referred to them by their specific names, such as char siu tang mian (roast pork noodle soup) and rousi tang mian (sliced pork noodle soup). The Japanese referred to all these noodle soup dishes as Nankin soba ('Nanjing noodles'). These noodle soups were particularly in high demand among Chinese students, who missed the cuisine of their homelands and found Japanese food bland in comparison.</p>
<p>The Japanese government passed a law in 1899 allowing resident aliens to own businesses outside their designated settlements. This development, in addition to the increased labor demands led to a spread of Chinese immigrants throughout Japan. By 1900, restaurants serving Chinese cuisine from Guangzhou and Shanghai offered a simple dish of noodles, a few toppings, and a broth flavored with salt and pork bones. Many Chinese living in Japan also pulled portable food stalls, selling ramen. By the mid-1900s, these stalls used a type of a musical horn called a charumera (チャルメラ, from the Portuguese charamela) to advertise their presence, a practice some vendors still retain via a loudspeaker and a looped recording.</p>
<h6>First Store</h6>
<p>According to ramen expert Hiroshi Osaki, the first specialized ramen shop was Rairaiken [ja] (来々軒), which opened in 1910 in Asakusa, Tokyo. The Japanese founder, Kan'ichi Ozaki (尾崎貫一), employed twelve Cantonese cooks from Yokohama's Chinatown and served the ramen arranged for Japanese customers. In contrast to most Japanese, who held prejudiced views toward Chinese cuisine, Ozaki grew up in Yokohama, where he experienced Chinese food firsthand and witnessed the popularity of noodle dishes in the city's Chinatown. Early versions of ramen were wheat noodles in broth topped with char siu. Ozaki changed the name of the noodle dishes from Nankin soba to Shina soba. The store also served standard Cantonese fare like wontons and shumai, and is sometimes regarded as the origin of Japanese-Chinese fusion dishes like chūkadon and tenshindon.</p>
<p>Rairaiken's original store closed in 1976, but related stores with the same name currently exist in other places, and have connections to the first store.</p>
<p>In 1925, a Chinese traveller named Fan Qinxing from Zhejiang province opened a ramen shop called Genraiken in Kitakata as an homage to the popular Rairaiken.</p>
<p>In 1933, Fu Xinglei (傅興雷), one of the twelve original chefs, opened a second Rairaiken in Yūtenji, Meguro Ward, Tokyo.</p>
<p>In 1968, one of Kan'ichi Ozaki's apprentices opened a store named Shinraiken ("New Raiken") in Chiba Prefecture.</p>
<p>In 2020, Ozaki's grandson and great-great-grandson re-opened the original Rairaiken as a store inside Shin-Yokohama Rāmen Museum.</p>
<h6>Popularization and Modernization</h6>
<p>After Japan's defeat in World War II, the American military occupied the country from 1945 to 1952. In December 1945, Japan recorded its worst rice harvest in 42 years, which caused food shortages as Japan had drastically reduced rice production during the war as production shifted to colonies in China and Formosa island. The US flooded the market with cheap wheat flour to deal with food shortages.</p>
<p>During the same period, millions of Japanese colonizers returned from China and other parts of East Asia. It was only in 1947, in the post-war period, that the term ramen was first recorded in Japan to refer to the southern Chinese noodle dish that originated in Yokohama Chinatown, possibly because it superficially resembled the lamian dishes they had encountered in northern China. Many Japanese repatriates were familiar with Chinese cuisine and opened yatai (food stalls) selling ramen. Jiaozi, a staple food of northern China, also began to be served as a complement to ramen at these stalls. These jiaozi were called gyoza by the Japanese, a name likely adopted in the puppet state of Manchukuo and derived from the Manchu word giyose.</p>
<p>From 1948 to 1951, bread consumption in Japan increased from 262,121 tons to 611,784 tons, but wheat also found its way into ramen, which most Japanese ate at black market food vendors to survive as the government food distribution system ran about 20 days behind schedule. Although the Americans maintained Japan's wartime ban on outdoor food vending, flour was secretly diverted from commercial mills into the black markets, where nearly 90 percent of stalls were under the control of gangsters related to the yakuza who extorted vendors for protection money. Thousands of ramen vendors were arrested during the occupation.</p>
<p>By 1950 wheat flour exchange controls were removed and restrictions on food vending loosened, which further boosted the number of ramen vendors: private companies even rented out yatai starter kits consisting of noodles, toppings, bowls, and chopsticks. Ramen yatai provided a rare opportunity for small-scale postwar entrepreneurship. The Americans also aggressively advertised the nutritional benefits of wheat and animal protein. The combination of these factors caused wheat noodles to gain prominence in Japan's rice-based culture. Gradually, ramen became associated with urban life.</p>
<p>In 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, the Taiwanese-Japanese founder and chairman of Nissin Foods. Named the greatest Japanese invention of the 20th century in a Japanese poll, instant ramen allowed anyone to make an approximation of this dish simply by adding boiling water.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1980s, ramen became a Japanese cultural icon and was studied around the world. At the same time, local varieties of ramen were hitting the national market and could even be ordered by their regional names. A ramen museum opened in Yokohama in 1994.</p>
